# ntp-clock
Micropython NTP clock for Raspberry Pi Pico W 

Forked from https://github.com/lammersch/ntp-timer

Uses WiFi to sync the Pico W to NTP, then drives a 4- or 6-digit multiplexed LED display. The LED multiplexing is currently crude, but you've got to start somewhere. [asyncio](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async/blob/master/v3/README.md) looks promising.

Very much a works-in-progress.
